# ðŸ§© 8-Puzzle Solver with AI

This project implements an **8-Puzzle** solver using **Artificial Intelligence algorithms**. The user can either play the game manually or allow AI to find the solution using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Play the **8-Puzzle** game interactively.
- Solve the puzzle using **BFS** or **IDDFS**.
- Display all visited states and the solution path.
- Simple and intuitive **C-based implementation**.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. The user selects **manual play** or **AI solver**.
2. The AI solver applies **BFS or IDDFS** to find the solution.
3. The visited states and solution path are displayed.
